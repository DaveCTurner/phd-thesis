#1 More use of 'definition' environment.

#2 DONE Use 'clockwise' and 'anticlockwise' instead of 'top' and 'bottom' when
talking about commuting diagrams. Check that cw and ccw are used correctly in
the text.

#3 Change use of 'ChCts' to 'FMCts' in HOPLA section.

#4 Check headings do not end in punctuation

#5 "Notions of Finiteness" section

#6 Too terse - need more cross-refs and explanation. Too many tantalising
throw-away comments.

#7 Need to emphasise the central story more.
