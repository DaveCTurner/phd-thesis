#1 More use of 'definition' environment.

#2 DONE Use 'clockwise' and 'anticlockwise' instead of 'top' and 'bottom' when

the text.

#3 Change use of 'ChCts' to 'FMCts' in HOPLA section.

#4 Check headings do not end in punctuation

#5 "Notions of Finiteness" section

#6 Too terse - need more cross-refs and explanation. Too many tantalising
throw-away comments.

#9 In "A Dep-Type Pres of FMPre", no equivalence between NPre and FMPre is
asserted above

#10 In 'Products' section of structure of FMLin, the union is not "taken"
anywhere in particular, but it is a "join" in that partial order.
