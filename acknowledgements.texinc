%\TODO{Acknowledgments}

Firstly I would like to wholeheartedly thank my supervisor, Glynn Winskel, for
all the ideas, support, encouragement, direction and freedom that he has given
me over the course of my research.
%
I hope that my work brings his vision for the future of semantics closer to
reality.
%
I would also like to thank the EPSRC for their generous support through their
grant ``Domain Theory for Concurrency'', number GR/T22049/01, whose principal
investigator was Prof. Winskel.

Sam Staton's positive influence on my work cannot be overstated, both for his
detailed mathematical support and his equally thorough typographical assistance.
%
All errors that remain are entirely my own work.

Andrew Pitts must also receive my appreciation for his auspiciously timed
seminar on nominal set theory at the start of my studies, as well as his
enthusiasm for all things nominal, and for his terrible puns:
%
it is fortunate that for this work his support seems to be infinite.
%
I regret not having capitalised more on Jamie Gabbay's equally infectious zeal
for the subject; I hope that he, and all the other participants of CANS, enjoy
reading this thesis as much as I have enjoyed producing it.

At the Computer Laboratory and at DPMMS I have met many other wonderful people
who have helped me along my way.
%
In particular I would like to thank Martin Hyland for pointing me in Glynn's
direction in the first place; Matthew Parkinson for helping me to hammer \LaTeX\
into shape and in particular for his macro to produce
\raisebox{-0.7ex}{$\matthat{\raisebox{0.7ex}{\text{very wide hats indeed}}}$};
and the Theory and Semantics Group for all our varied conversations on all
manner of topics over tea and beer and games of pool.


Clare College has been a wonderfully supportive --- and remarkably patient ---
home to me for the past decade, and the source of many valuable friendships.


My family have played a larger part in this work than perhaps they realise.
%
I would like to thank Mum and Dad and Andy and Di and Howard and all my
grandparents for giving me the encouragement, the work ethic and the environment
that brought me here.
%
I hope you can make it as far as page \pageref{end-of-layman} and I hope it
makes you proud.

Finally, to Tess, who is the most wonderful person in the world:
%
without you I would have never got so far, so happily, with so much of my sanity
still intact.
%
You made it all worthwhile.
%
This is for you.

To all of you, thank you.
