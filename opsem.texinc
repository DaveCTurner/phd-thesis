\section{Operational Semantics}
\label{opsem}

Nominal HOPLA is given an operational semantics in the style of a labelled
transition system. That a term $t$ such that $\tjudge{}{}{t}{\typeP}$ may
perform an action $p$ such that $\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ and resume as
the term $t'$ is written \begin{equation} \ajudge{\typeP}{t}{p}{t'}.
\end{equation}
%
The operational
semantics of closed, well-typed terms are defined below. These rules define
the semantics only of well-typed terms in the sense that each of these rules
has an additional premise, omitted for clarity, that the term on the left of
the transition in the conclusion has the correct type.

\subsection{Properties of the Operational Semantics}

The following few lemmas demonstrate that the operational semantics given
above interacts well with the type system described in section \ref{tjudge}.

\begin{lemma} \label{ajudgeimptjudge} If $\ajudge{\typeP}{t}{p}{t'}$ then
$\tjudge{}{}{t}{\typeP}$.  \end{lemma} \begin{proof} By definition.\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{ajudgeimpatjudge} If $\ajudge{\typeP}{t}{p}{t'}$ then
there exists a unique $\typePp$ such that the judgement
$\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ holds.  \end{lemma} \begin{proof} By
induction over the derivation of $\ajudge{\typeP}{t}{p}{t'}$.  \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
If $\ajudge{\typeP}{t}{p}{t'}$ and $\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ then
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$.  \end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By induction on the derivation of $\ajudge{\typeP}{t}{p}{t'}$ as follows.

\subparagraph{Recursion} The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ and furthermore that
$\ajudge{\typeP}{\termsubst{t}{\rec{x}{t}}{x}}{p}{t'}$ so that
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typeP}$ follows immediately by induction.

\subparagraph{Prefix} The induction hypothesis says that
$\tjudge{}{}{\bang{t}}{\typelift\typeP}$ so that $\tjudge{}{}{t}{\typeP}$ by
lemma \ref{closedtermtypebackwards}(\ref{closedtermtypebackwardsbang}), as
required.

\subparagraph{Match} The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ and
$\ajudge{\typeP}{\termsubst{t}{u'}{x}}{p}{t'}$, so that
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typeP}$ follows immediately by induction.

\subparagraph{Name Abstraction} The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typedelta\typeP}{\newaction{a}{p}}{\typePpp}$ and
$\ajudge{\typeP}{t}{p}{t'}$. Therefore $\typePpp = \typedelta\typePp$ for some
$\typePp$, and hence
$\atjudge{}{\typedelta\typeP}{\newaction{a}{p}}{\typedelta\typePp}$.  From
lemma \ref{closedactiontypebackwards}(\ref{closedactiontypebackwardsnew})
therefore $\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ so that by induction
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ and hence
$\tjudge{}{}{\new{a}{t'}}{\typedelta\typePp}$ as required.

\subparagraph{Name Application} The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ and also
$\ajudge{\typedelta\typeP}{t}{\newaction{a}{p}}{\new{a}{t'}}$ so that
$\atjudge{}{\typedelta\typeP}{\newaction{a}{p}}{\typedelta\typePp}$ and hence
by induction $\tjudge{}{}{\new{a}{t'}}{\typedelta\typePp}$.  From lemma
\ref{closedtermtypebackwards}(\ref{closedtermtypebackwardsnew}) therefore
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ as required.

\subparagraph{Function Abstraction} The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typemap{\typeQ}{\typeP}}{\mapaction{u}{p}}{\typePp}$ and
$\ajudge{\typeP}{\termsubst{t}{u}{x}}{p}{t'}$. From lemma
\ref{closedactiontypebackwards}(\ref{closedactiontypebackwardsmap}) therefore
$\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ and hence by induction
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ as required.

\subparagraph{Function Application} The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$ and also
$\ajudge{\typemap{\typeQ}{\typeP}}{t}{\mapaction{u}{p}}{t'}$.  By lemma
\ref{ajudgeimpatjudge} there exists a unique $\typePpp$ such that
$\atjudge{}{\typemap{\typeQ}{\typeP}}{\mapaction{u}{p}}{\typePpp}$ and by
lemma \ref{closedactiontypebackwards}(\ref{closedactiontypebackwardsmap})
$\tjudge{}{}{u}{\typeQ}$ and $\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePpp}$ so that
$\typePpp = \typePp$. Therefore by induction $\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ as
required.

\subparagraph{Labelling} The induction hypothesis says that
$\ajudge{\typePsub{\ell_0}}{t}{p}{t'}$ and also that
$\atjudge{}{\stdtypesum}{\labelaction{\ell_0}{p}}{\typePp}$.  From lemma
\ref{closedactiontypebackwards}(\ref{closedactiontypebackwardslabel})
therefore $\atjudge{}{\typePsub{\ell_0}}{p}{\typePp}$ so that
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ by induction as required.

\subparagraph{Label Projection} The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typePsub{\ell_0}}{p}{\typePp}$ and
$\ajudge{\stdtypesum}{t}{\labelaction{\ell_0}{p}}{t'}$.  From the typing
rules $\atjudge{}{\stdtypesum}{\labelaction{\ell_0}{p}}{t'}$ so that
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ by induction as required.

\subparagraph{Recursive Type Folding} The induction hypothesis gives the
statements that
$\ajudge{\typeP_j[\typerec{}{P}{\typeP}/\vec{P}]}{t}{p}{t'}$ and
$\atjudge{}{\typerec{j}{P}{\typeP}}{\absaction{p}}{\typePp}$.  From lemma
\ref{closedactiontypebackwards}(\ref{closedactiontypebackwardsabs}) therefore
$\atjudge{}{\typeP_j[\typerec{}{P}{\typeP}/\vec{P}]}{p}{\typePp}$, so that
$\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ by induction as required.

\subparagraph{Recursive Type Unfolding} The induction hypothesis gives the
statements that
$\atjudge{}{\typeP_j[\typerec{}{P}{\typeP}/\vec{P}]}{p}{\typePp}$ and
$\ajudge{\typerec{j}{P}{\typeP}}{t}{\absaction{p}}{t'}$. From the typing rules
it follows that $\atjudge{}{\typerec{j}{P}{\typeP}}{\absaction{p}}{t'}$ so
that $\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$ by induction as required.

\subparagraph{Nondeterministic Sum}
The induction hypothesis says that
$\atjudge{}{\typeP}{p}{\typePp}$
and $\ajudge{\typeP}{t_{i_0}}{p}{t'}$ so that $\tjudge{}{}{t'}{\typePp}$
by induction as required.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:opsembackwards} If the conclusion of certain
derivation rules for the operational semantics is derivable then so are its
premises, in a sense that is made precise below.  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
%
\item \label{lemma:opsembackwards:apply} If
$\ajudge{\typeP}{\apply{t}{u}{\typeQ}}{p}{t'}$ then
$\ajudge{\typemap{\typeQ}{\typeP}}{t}{\mapaction{u}{p}}{t'}$.
%
\item \label{lemma:opsembackwards:lproj} If
$\ajudge{\typePsub{\ell_0}}{\lproj{\ell_0}{t}}{p}{t'}$ then
$\ajudge{\stdtypesum}{t}{\labelaction{\ell_0}{p}}{t'}$.
%
\item \label{lemma:opsembackwards:newapply} If
$\ajudge{\typeP}{\newapply{t}{a}}{p}{t'}$ then
$\ajudge{\typedelta\typeP}{t}{\newaction{a}{p}}{\new{a}{t'}}$.
%
\item \label{lemma:opsembackwards:rep} If
$\ajudge{\typeP_j[\typerec{j}{P}{\typeP}/\vec{P}]}{\rep{t}}{p}{t'}$ then
$\ajudge{\typerec{j}{P}{\typeP}}{t}{\absaction{p}}{t'}$.  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} The derivation rules are completely syntax-directed, so the
result is immediate.  \end{proof}
