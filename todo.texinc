\chapter*{TODO items}

\begin{enumerate}

\item More use of 'definition' environment.

\item DONE Use 'clockwise' and 'anticlockwise' instead of 'top' and 'bottom' when
talking about commuting diagrams. Check that cw and ccw are used correctly in
the text.

\item Change use of 'ChCts' to 'FMCts' in HOPLA section.

\item Check headings do not end in punctuation

\item "Notions of Finiteness" section

\item Too terse - need more cross-refs and explanation. Too many tantalising
throw-away comments.

\item Need to emphasise the central story more.

\item Use P, Q, ... for finite elements, not x, y, ...

\item Conclusions? Need more `this is what has just been done' sections.

\item Check scope of $a$ and $s$ and particularly the assumption $a \notin s$.

\item Modal Logic??

\end{enumerate}
